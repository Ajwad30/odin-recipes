                            <h4>Here are the steps to making this dish:</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Set the heat to medium and cook the sausage, ground beef, onions, and garlic until they are browned.</li>
                                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato pasta, tomato sauce, and water. Season this with sugar, basil,
                                    fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1tsp of salt, pepper, and 2tbsp of parsley.</li>
                                <li>Cover and allow to simmer for roughly an hour and a half, occasionally stirring.</li>
                                <li>Fill a large pot with water and lightly salt before bringing to a boil. Add your lasagna noodles and
                                    cook for 8-10 minutes before draining the noodles and rinsing with cold water.</li>
                                <li>Combine ricotta cheese, egg, leftover parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt in a mixing bowl.</li>
                                <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F or 190 degrees C.</li>
                                <li>Spread 1.5 cups of meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Place 6 noodles lengthwise over meatsauce
                                    and spread half of the ricotta cheese mix overtop of the noodles. Place 1/3'rd of the mozzarella cheese slices
                                    on top. Spread another 1.5 cups of meat sauce on top of the mozarella along with 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.</li>
                                <li>Repeat these layering steps and spread remaining mozzarella and parmesean at the top.</li>
                                <li>Cover your baking dish with foil, making sure the cheese does not touch the foil (Alternatively, spray the
                                    foil with cooking spray) in order to prevent sticking.</li>
                                <li>Bake in oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Allow to cool for 15 minutes before cutting in and enjoying.</li>
